    "This Jupyter Notebook shows how the products shown in the C3S seasonal  __[graphical products](https://climate.copernicus.eu/charts/packages/c3s_seasonal/)__ can be calculated from data in the __[Climate Data Store](#configuration)__ (CDS), and plotted. The C3S seasonal graphical and data products are described in this __[documentation page](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/C3S+seasonal+forecast+product+descriptions)__. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example code can be used as the basis for creating graphical products which are not part of the C3S suite. In this example we look at monthly mean daily minimum temperature forecasts (for one system, ECMWF System 51), which is a variable available in the CDS dataset but not the graphical products. A 'tercile summary' is computed from tercile probabilities. An ensemble mean anomaly is also calculated and plotted with significance testing applied. This will be used in a further example to create multi-system combinations.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",

    "These plots are similar to the monthly C3S graphical products. Note that here we have plotted the first month of the forecast (February, or leadtime_month = 1), while in the graphical products we show the monthly forecasts starting with the month following the release month (which would be March in this case). The three-month aggregations in the graphical products could be created in a similar manner, by combining the corresponding monthly means."
