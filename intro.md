# C3S seasonal forecast applications and workflows

This Jupyter Book contains a collection of quality assessments of C3S data produced by external evaluators under the C3S2_520 contract, which provides an **evaluation and quality control (EQC)** function for selected datasets on the climate data store (CDS).

C3S has established an EQC framework for all its products and services to ensure that users are served well and that this will continue to be the case as their needs evolve. The main goal of the EQC for CDS datasets function is to develop precise statements about data quality that pertain to well-identified use cases. Those statements, in combination with other documented information about the datasets, constitute a knowledge base that can help users to assess fitness for purpose, given their needs and requirements.

## Running the Notebooks

Some of the analysis in the applications and workflows is not compute or data intensive, and so the Notebooks (.ipynb files) can be downloaded, adapted, and run on freely available cloud platforms, or on your own computing resources.
